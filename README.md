# GeoData@SciLi Open Data and Projects
This page links to individual repositories that we use for our work at [GeoData@SciLi](https://libguides.brown.edu/gis/geodata_scili) to create free and open datasets and to support various projects. All of our repositories begin with the prefix "geodata" followed by an underscore and suffix that indicates the project name.

## Datasets
* [Ocean State Spatial Database](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_ossdb) (public): a spatial database of contemporary features and census data for basic thematic mapping and analysis within Rhode Island.
* [Providence Geocoded Crime Incidents](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_pvdcrime) (public): geocoded data from the Providence Police Case Logs.
* [UN ICSC Retail Price Indexes](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_un_retail_idx) (public): time series of retail price indices that reflect the relative cost-of-living of United Nations staff at duty stations in countries around the world. The indices cover various categories of goods and services, and the data is initially captured quarterly, then every two months, from 2004 to the present.

## Tutorials
* [Python API Examples](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_api_tutorials) (public): working Python scripts with sample output that illustrate how to use APIs. Examples include US census data, intraday stock trades, and metadata for New York Times articles.
* [PDF Tutorials](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_pdf_tutorials) (public): storage for text-based tutorials and sample data we create. Visit [Brown GIS and Data Tutorials](https://libguides.brown.edu/gis_data_tutorials) for formatted descriptions that link to these materials.
* [Using Google Earth Engine with Colab](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_earthengine) (public): working CoLab notebook and tutorial that demonstrates how to use GEE to access and process satellite imagery from LANDSAT, SENTINEL, MODIS and other series.

## Projects
* [GeoData@SciLi Metadata Scripts](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_metadata_ogm) (public): our implementation of the Aardavrk metadata schema to produce YAML metadata records validated with Python's jsonschema.
* [Gallup Microdata Processing](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_gallup) (script public, data private): scripts for creating lists of variables and extracts of data from Gallup Microdata files.
* [Map Inventory Project](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_map_inventory) (public): program with GUI for inventorying our USGS topo maps.
* [Parse IA Twitter Stream Files](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_parse_ia_twitter) (public): parse Internet Archive Twitter Stream Grab daily files for geolocated tweets.
* [Raster Temperature and Point Observation Overlay](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_raster_temp_overlay) (public): overlay observations with dates onto PRISM temperature rasters and pull temperatures for corresponding dates. 
* [Stolen Relations Geocoding](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_stolen_relations) (internal): script for looking up coordinates for place names that appear in historical records of indigenous enslavement in the Americas compiled by the [Stolen Relations](https://indigenousslavery.org/) project.
