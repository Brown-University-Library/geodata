# GeoData@SciLi Open Data
This is the primary landing page for open data projects at GeoData@SciLi. This page links to individual repos that we use for our work to create free and open datasets. All of our repositories begin with the prefix "geodata" followed by an underscore and suffix that indicates the project name.

## Datasets
* [UN ICSC Retail Price Indexes](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_un_retail_idx): time series of retail price indices that reflect the cost-of-living of United Nations international staff stationed at duty stations in countries around the world. The index is relative to New York City and the data is initially captured quarterly, then bimonthly, from 2004 to present.

## Projects
* [Stolen Relations](): geocoding scripts etc...
