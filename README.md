# GeoData@SciLi Open Data
This page links to individual repos that we use for our work to create free and open datasets. All of our repositories begin with the prefix "geodata" followed by an underscore and suffix that indicates the project name.

## Datasets
* [UN ICSC Retail Price Indexes](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_un_retail_idx): time series of retail price indices that reflect the cost-of-living of United Nations international staff stationed at duty stations in countries around the world. The index is relative to New York City and the data is initially captured quarterly, then every two months, from 1997 to the present.

## Projects
* [Stolen Relations Geocoding](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_stolen_relations): script for looking up coordinates for place names that appear in historical records of indigenous enslavement in the Americas compiled by the [Stolen Relations](https://indigenousslavery.org/) project.
