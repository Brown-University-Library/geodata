# GeoData@SciLi Open Data and Project Files
This page links to individual repositories that we use for our work at [GeoData@SciLi](https://libguides.brown.edu/gis/geodata_scili) to create free and open datasets and to support various projects. All of our repositories begin with the prefix "geodata" followed by an underscore and suffix that indicates the project name.

## Datasets
* [UN ICSC Retail Price Indexes](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_un_retail_idx) (public): time series of retail price indices that reflect the relative cost-of-living of United Nations staff at duty stations in countries around the world. The indices cover various categories of goods and services, and the data is initially captured quarterly, then every two months, from 2004 to the present.

## Projects
* [Gallup Microdata Processing](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_gallup) (script public, data private): scripts for creating lists of variables and extracts of data from Gallup Microdata files.
* [Stolen Relations Geocoding](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/geodata_stolen_relations) (internal): script for looking up coordinates for place names that appear in historical records of indigenous enslavement in the Americas compiled by the [Stolen Relations](https://indigenousslavery.org/) project.
