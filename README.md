# GeoData@SciLi Open Data
This is the primary landing page for open data projects at GeoData@SciLi. This page links to individual repos that we use for our work to create free and open datasets. All of our repositories begin with the prefix "geodata" followed by an underscore and suffix that indicates the project name.
